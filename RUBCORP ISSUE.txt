Root cause of failure
The job failed due to a RuboCop style violation in the file lib/release_highlights/validator.rb. The RuboCop linter detected a Rails/Output offense on line 26, column 7, where a puts statement is being used to write to stdout:

puts "[Profiler] Validation for #{file} took #{time.round(4)}s"
Insert at cursor

The RuboCop rule Rails/Output prohibits writing directly to stdout in Rails applications and recommends using Rails's logger instead. This violation caused the linting job to exit with code 1, indicating failure.
The sequence of events was:

Bundle installation completed successfully
Database configuration was set up
RuboCop was executed to check code style compliance
RuboCop found 1 offense in the validator file
The job terminated with exit code 1 due to the style violation


Example Fix
To resolve this issue, replace the puts statement with Rails logger usage. Here's the specific change needed in lib/release_highlights/validator.rb at line 26:
Current code:

puts "[Profiler] Validation for #{file} took #{time.round(4)}s"
Insert at cursor

Fixed code:

Rails.logger.info "[Profiler] Validation for #{file} took #{time.round(4)}s"
Insert at cursor

Alternatively, if you need to maintain the current behavior temporarily, you could:


Disable the rule for this specific line by adding a comment:

puts "[Profiler] Validation for #{file} took #{time.round(4)}s" # rubocop:disable Rails/Output
Insert at cursor



Use a different logging approach if Rails logger is not appropriate for this context:

warn "[Profiler] Validation for #{file} took #{time.round(4)}s"
Insert at cursor



The RuboCop output indicates this offense is autocorrectable, so you could also run rubocop -a to automatically fix this issue, though manual review of the automatic correction would be recommended to ensure it meets your logging requirements.
